	 Planning my CLI project started with a lot of  broad information I had learnt in the program this far. I  had very little idea how to use 'pry', I wasalways confused when using it , and what did  it actually do,  thus i tried to avoid it.  I had no idea how to use Github, besides just typing "learn submit" in learn IDE to submit my labs. And I practically didn't know anything on how to use Terminal, and OMG scraping terrified me. 
​
      I was on the schedule with my labs, but it felt like I'm running a marathon, trying to grasp the concepts under the pressure of time, to finally get to the instructions and requirements for my CLI app.  
      When I read the requirements , at one moment I thought it was easy, because I learnt all this information , and another point I was overwhelmed, making choices was tough, which website to scrape, how my objects are going to interact with one and other. to prepare for a project I had to go a few weeks back read trough lab materials  again,  I  watched a “walk trough lecture” by  and before actually start planning it talk to my education coach, who told me, one very simple , but very important thing " You are going to learn a lot as you build this project!”;I didn't didn't realize how true this statement was, until I started coding the project, and  constantly hitting one wall after another. When I got stuck I learnt the most. I was getting stuck almost on every step of my program. I started with finding a scrapable website, at least the website I thought was easily scrapable.
      I wanted  my CLI gem to represent something of my surroundings and  Brooklyn Museum  like the best idea to represent my surroundings. Also, I like the museum for it's not so mainstream exhibitions. The museum is definitely worth a visit. So my CLI gem goes out to Brooklyn Museum website scrapes current exhibitions from  the exhibition page and returns the names of the exhibitions in a numbered list, asks a user to enter the number associated with the current  exhibitions the user would like more information on, and displays three properties of the exhibition if the existing key is entered.  
     At the planning stage the scraping part of the entire project  seemed the most terrifying one. It was a fresh concept we only spent a few labs, learning it right before the  project assignment .  But it turned out to be one of the easiest parts of the program. To find the nodes I need  for scraping  I used Repl.it  to have a better visual of the way Nokogiri displays the code. Once I got the node i need , I began setting up the gem environment   following our technical coach's advice I installed a template for my gem using bundle gem, it took me  quite a few tries to properly interact with terminal, learn and use the commands, but I did it !!!
